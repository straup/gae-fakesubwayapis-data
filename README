These are the raw data files used by Fake Subway APIs:

      http://fakesubwayapis.appspot.com
      http://github.com/straup/gae-fakesubwayapis

They are not 100% compliant with the Google Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)
but are modeled after the agency, stops and routes definitions with "fsa_"
extensions where necessary.

      http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html

The idea being that you can drop in an 'agency.txt' file, a 'stops.txt' file and
optionally a 'routes.txt' file for a given service and start up a new service
endpoint on Fake Subway APIs by simply adding a new entry to the URL dispatcher.

Here's an example:

# agency.txt

agency_id,agency_name,agency_url,agency_timezone,fsa_id_template,fsa_url_template
bart,"Bay Area Rapid Transit","http://www.bart.gov/",America/Los_Angeles,lower,"http://www.bart.gov/stations/%s"

# stops.txt

stop_id,stop_name,stop_desc,stop_lat,stop_lon,zone_id,fsa_stop_id
orin,Orinda,,,,,orin
ftvl,Fruitvale (Oakland),,,,,ftvl
civc,Civic Center (SF),,,,,civc
...

It's worth noting that the final format is still up in the air. (Personally, I
don't love GTFS but if people are using it and it's safe to add "fsa_"
extensions then what I think isn't that important.)
